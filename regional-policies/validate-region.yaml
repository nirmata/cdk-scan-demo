      When managing containers within AWS ECS, it's crucial to enforce security measures to prevent unauthorized modifications.
      One significant aspect is ensuring the resources are deployed to the 'us-west-1' region. 
      This policy checks if ECS Containers are configured to be deployed in 'us-west-1'.
spec:
  rules:
    - name: validate-region
      match:
        all:
        - (values(Resources)[?Type == 'AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition'] | length(@) > `0`): true
      assert:
        all:
        - message: ECS Containers should have read-only access to its root filesystem
          check:
            ~.(values(Resources)[?Type == 'AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition']):
                Properties:
                    ~.(ContainerDefinitions[]):
